# Gemini Context

## Operational Mandates
- **Plan Node Default**: For tasks >3 steps, update `plan.md` or `tasks/todo.md` before execution. Stop and re-plan if blocked.
- **Subagent Strategy**: Use subagents for research and analysis to keep main context clean.
- **Autonomous Bug Fixing**: Resolve issues with clear evidence (logs/tests) without asking.
- **Elegance Check**: Pause before implementation to ensure the most elegant solution.
- **Self-Improvement**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after any user correction.
- **Hardware Standard**: Use `c7200` (IOS 15.x) for core and advanced features. Reserve `c3725` (IOS 12.4) only for simple stubs/branches to avoid technology limitations.
