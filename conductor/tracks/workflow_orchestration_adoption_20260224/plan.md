# Implementation Plan: Workflow Orchestration Adoption

## Phase 1: Foundation & Global Tracking
- [x] Initialize Track and register in `conductor/tracks.md`
- [x] Create global `tasks/` directory and initialize `todo.md` and `lessons.md`

## Phase 2: Workflow Integration
- [x] Update `conductor/workflow.md` with Planning Node, Subagent Protocol, and Elegance Check
- [x] Integrate "Autonomous Mandate" (Fix on Evidence) into workflow
- [x] Update `GEMINI.md` with new operational mandates

## Phase 3: The Learning Loop & Refinement
- [x] Update `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` to distinguish Technical vs. Process lessons
- [x] Populate `tasks/lessons.md` with initial process rules
- [x] Verify workflow deliverables (Workflow, Lessons, Todo, GEMINI context)

## Verification Report
- **Workflow**: Updated with Planning Node, Subagent Strategy, Elegance Check, and Autonomous Mandate.
- **GEMINI context**: Operational mandates updated.
- **Tracking**: `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md` initialized.
- **Learning**: `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` updated with process strategy lessons.
