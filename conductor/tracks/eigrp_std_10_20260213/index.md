# Track: Implement EIGRP Lab 10: Named Mode Advanced Features

**Status**: Complete
**Date**: 2026-02-13

## Summary

Created Lab 10 to properly house the EIGRP Named Mode features (SHA-256 auth, wide metrics,
af-interface tuning) that were previously incorrectly placed in Lab 05. Lab 10 targets the
c7200 routers (R1 and R6) which run IOS 15.3 and support Named Mode.

Initial configs derive from Lab 09 solutions (post cascade fix). Only R1 and R6 solution
configs are modified; R2-R5 and R7 remain on Classic Mode unchanged from initial state.
