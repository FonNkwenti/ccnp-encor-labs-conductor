# Product Guidelines - CCNP ENCOR Lab Series

## Voice and Tone
- **Narrative & Scenario-Based:** Lab workbooks must contextualize technical tasks within a realistic professional scenario (e.g., "As a lead engineer for a global enterprise, your task is to..."). This approach increases engagement and prepares the user for real-world consulting challenges.
- **Professional & Authoritative:** Maintain a professional and authoritative "voice" that positions these labs as the definitive resource for CCNP ENCOR mastery.

## Visual and Technical Standards
- **Standardized Diagrams:** All topology diagrams must use Cisco-style Draw.io icons with consistent labeling (e.g., interface IDs must always be placed on or near the corresponding link).
- **Formatted CLI Output:** Use code blocks for all CLI output. Verification steps must highlight the specific lines or values the user should expect to see in a successful configuration.

## Workbook Structure
- **Challenge-First Approach:** Workbooks should be structured to present the topology and high-level objectives first, followed by a troubleshooting or implementation scenario. Detailed configuration steps are provided only in the solution section, forcing users to attempt the configuration independently first.

## Terminology and Conventions
- **Cisco Official Terminology:** Strictly adhere to official Cisco terminology (e.g., "Administrative Distance", "Feasible Successor", "Metric Weights") to ensure maximum alignment with the CCNP ENCOR exam blueprint.
