Generate all labs for a chapter with proper chaining and continuity: $ARGUMENTS

Follow `.agent/skills/chapter-builder/SKILL.md` exactly for all orchestration logic,
config chaining rules, device activation, topology continuity, and validation.

## Additional project-specific step

After each lab package is complete (per the skill's Step 3), also generate `challenges.md`
for that lab — 4 standalone challenge exercises extending the core lab tasks.
